Citra is an open-source Nintendo 2DS/3DS/New 3DS/New 3DS XL/New 2DS XL emulator written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds for Windows.

Citra emulates a subset of the hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications, and it's also able to run many commercial games! Some of these don't run at a playable state, but we are working every day to advance the project forward.

Citra is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.
